# Project-9-REST-API
<!-- Progress on this project
Already finished #1 to 5 and set the testing environment in Postman!


remember to cheeck the code for users.js route and auth-user.js since I am getting   "message": "Authentication required." -->

<!--when you get back, make sure the user and course.js files are updated according to their initial set up not the new one that Chat gave you!>
